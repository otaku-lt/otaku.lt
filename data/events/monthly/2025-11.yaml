    Special screening of Satoshi Kon's masterpiece "Millennium Actress" (2001) in Japanese with Lithuanian subtitles.
    
    A filmmaker sets out to interview former actress Chiyoko Fujiwara, who was a major star in the 1950s and 1960s. As Chiyoko recounts her life story, the line between reality and cinema becomes increasingly blurred. This mind-bending exploration of memory, cinema, and love is one of Satoshi Kon's greatest achievements.
