    Special screening of Satoshi Kon's masterpiece "Millennium Actress" (2001) in Japanese with Lithuanian subtitles.
    
    A filmmaker sets out to interview former actress Chiyoko Fujiwara, who was a major star in the 1950s and 1960s. As Chiyoko recounts her life story, the line between reality and cinema becomes increasingly blurred. This mind-bending exploration of memory, cinema, and love is one of Satoshi Kon's greatest achievements.
    
    This special screening is part of the "See in Cinema" series, bringing classic films back to the big screen.
